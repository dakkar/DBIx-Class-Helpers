=head1 DESCRIPTION

Once in a blue moon you will find yourself in the frustrating position of
needing a vanilla ResultSet when all you have is a ResultSet that has a search
applied to it.  That's what this helper is for; it gives you a method to get at an
unsearched version of the ResultSet.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<bare>

 my $plain_rs = $searched_rs->bare;

Takes no arguments and returns the ResultSet as if nothing were searched against
it at all.
